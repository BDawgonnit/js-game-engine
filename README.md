# JS Game Engine #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

## Example ##

## What is this repository for? ##

* A custom game engine being developed with aspirations to exceed the quality of currently available JS game engines...but is mostly for educational purposes at the moment.
* Version 0.0.1

## How do I get set up? ##

* Install node and pull the repo into a folder of your choice on your machine. The node modules are already included in the repo, so you shouldn't even need to install them.
* Configuration (TBD)
* Dependencies: node & npm, node modules (babel-core, babili, eslint)
* Test Dependencies: Mocha and Chai node modules
* Database configuration (N/A)
* How to run tests:

  * OR go to ***localhost:8080/test/*** in your browser when the server is running
* Deployment instructions (TBD)

## Contribution guidelines ##

* Writing tests:
  * Tests are defined in test/index.js
  * Tests are using the TDD (Not BDD) format (see Mocha's documentation for more details)
  * Tests should be separated by module "suites"
  * Calls to assert() throw an error when the first parameter evaluates to true. Second parameter is the error message
* Code review (TBD)
* Other guidelines (TBD)
